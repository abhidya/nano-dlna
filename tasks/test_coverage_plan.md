# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status

The nano-dlna project has been enhanced with improved test coverage for several key components:

1. **Renderer Router**: Added comprehensive tests for all endpoints in the renderer router, including:
   - Starting and stopping renderers
   - Getting renderer status
   - Listing renderers, projectors, and scenes
   - Starting projectors with default scenes
   - AirPlay device discovery and management
   - Pause and resume functionality

2. **Depth Router**: Added tests for the depth processing functionality, including:
   - Uploading depth maps
   - Previewing depth maps
   - Segmenting depth maps using various methods (KMeans, threshold, bands)
   - Previewing segmentations
   - Exporting masks
   - Deleting depth maps

3. **Streaming Router**: Enhanced tests for streaming functionality, including:
   - Getting streaming status
   - Starting streaming sessions
   - Stopping streaming sessions
   - Error handling for invalid devices and videos

## Test Coverage Goals

### Short-term Goals

1. **Increase Overall Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage across the codebase.

2. **Critical Components**: Ensure 90%+ coverage for critical components:
   - DLNA device control
   - Streaming functionality
   - Device discovery
   - Video playback

3. **Edge Cases**: Add tests for edge cases and error conditions:
   - Network failures
   - Invalid input data
   - Concurrent operations
   - Resource cleanup

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Integration Tests**: Develop more integration tests that verify the interaction between components:
   - End-to-end device discovery and control
   - Complete streaming workflow
   - Frontend-backend integration

2. **Performance Tests**: Add tests to verify performance requirements:
   - Response time for API endpoints
   - Streaming performance
   - Device discovery time

3. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Improve mocking of external dependencies to make tests more reliable:
   - Network services
   - File system operations
   - External APIs

### Long-term Goals

1. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated test runs.

2. **Test Data Management**: Create a comprehensive test data management strategy.

3. **Mutation Testing**: Implement mutation testing to verify test quality.

4. **Property-based Testing**: Explore property-based testing for complex components.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements

- [x] Add tests for renderer router
- [x] Add tests for depth router
- [x] Enhance tests for streaming router
- [x] Create a script to run all tests with coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Coverage Expansion

- [ ] Add tests for device manager
- [ ] Add tests for streaming service
- [ ] Add tests for config service
- [ ] Add tests for DLNA device implementation

### Phase 3: Integration and Edge Cases

- [ ] Develop integration tests
- [ ] Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Implement performance tests

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement mutation testing
- [ ] Explore property-based testing

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**: Keep tests organized by component and functionality.

2. **Test Independence**: Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on the state from other tests.

3. **Mocking**: Use mocks and fixtures to isolate components during testing.

4. **Assertions**: Use specific assertions that clearly indicate what is being tested.

5. **Documentation**: Document test cases and their purpose.

6. **Maintenance**: Regularly update tests as the codebase evolves.

## Monitoring and Reporting

1. **Coverage Reports**: Generate and review coverage reports regularly.

2. **Test Quality Metrics**: Track metrics like test pass rate, coverage, and execution time.

3. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation up to date.

## Conclusion

Improving test coverage is an ongoing process that requires continuous effort and attention. By following this plan, we can ensure that the nano-dlna project maintains high quality and reliability as it evolves.
