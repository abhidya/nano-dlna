# Claude Working Rules

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **NEVER start or stop the dashboard** - User runs it in another thread for live feedback
2. **NEVER use ./run_dashboard.sh or ./stop_dashboard.sh commands**
3. **Changes take effect immediately** - User will test and provide feedback
4. **ALWAYS disambiguate task first** - Write complete plan, get sign off BEFORE coding
5. **Update progress doc with plan** - Document approach before implementation
6. **Remember ALL components** - Backend + Database + Frontend must be updated together

## Code Analysis
1. **Always trace code paths from actual logs/errors** - Don't guess, follow the execution
2. **Reference specific line numbers and files** - e.g., "Line 347 in device_service.py"
3. **Don't assume - verify in the code** - If unsure, grep/read to confirm

## System Thinking
1. **Consider ALL components for any change**: Frontend + API + Backend + DB
2. **State consistency matters** - Don't fix backend without updating DB/frontend
3. **Architecture over patches** - Understand the full flow before proposing fixes

## Communication Style
1. **Requirements first** - Define WHAT needs fixing before HOW to fix it
2. **Code over commentary** - Show concrete findings, not abstract explanations
3. **Stay focused on verifiable issues** - Only propose what can be proven in code

## Professional Standards
1. **Never mention AI/Anthropic/Claude in commits or code**
2. **Keep output technical and factual**
3. **Focus on bugs and solutions, not theory**

## Problem Solving
1. **Start with the error/log message**
2. **Trace backwards to find root cause**
3. **Verify assumptions before proposing fixes**
4. **Think about unintended consequences**
