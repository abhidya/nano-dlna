# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  File: docs/architecture.md @architecture.md
  Required parsing:
  1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
  2. Extract and understand:
     - System components (CLI and Web Dashboard)
     - Core modules and their responsibilities
     - Device discovery and control mechanisms
     - Media streaming functionality
     - Data flow patterns between components
     - Video looping implementation details

  Key architecture components:
  - Core CLI Tool (nanodlna package)
    - DLNA discovery via SSDP protocol
    - SOAP/XML communication for device control
    - HTTP streaming server
    - Playback monitoring and looping

  - Web Dashboard (web/ directory)
    - FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy database
    - React frontend with device and video management
    - Device manager with shared core functionality
    - Thread-based looping implementation

  Architectural constraints:
  - Maintain separation between CLI and Web Dashboard implementations
  - Keep core DLNA functionality reusable between components
  - Follow established patterns for device control and management
  - Maintain compatibility with various DLNA device types
  
  Error handling:
  1. If file not found: Check updated architecture in code directly
  2. If diagram parse fails: Reference key files identified in code review 
  3. If architectural violation detected: Consult updated technical documentation
