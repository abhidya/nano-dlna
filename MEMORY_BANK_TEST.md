# Memory Bank Test

This is a test to see if the memory bank MCP server can store and recall information about our investigation.

## Key Findings Summary
- Function signatures need cleanup (120+ files analyzed)
- Threading issues in DeviceManager (7 locks, deadlock risk)  
- API endpoints missing proper return types
- Frontend needs TypeScript migration
- Critical priority: CLI module type annotations

## Action Items
1. Fix DeviceManager.update_device_status() - too many parameters
2. Add return types to API endpoints
3. Decompose 173-line auto_play_video method
4. Simplify threading architecture

The investigation is complete and documented in memory-bank/ directory.
